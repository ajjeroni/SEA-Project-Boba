/**
 * Here, I am creating my own array of objects for the tea bases.
 * I am choosing 3 types of tea bases, Oolong, Black and Green. 
 * For each base I will choose 3 types of teas.
 * Each tea will have a name, type, a small discription, and a URL (preferably 1200 x 1200)
 * I also export it to use in scripts.js
